# What's Upblock?

Upblock is a game I made for submission to the [2024 GMTK game jam](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2024).

The theme was "Built to Scale". In Upblock, you place blocks, trying to build as tall of a tower as you can in 60 seconds.
*Be careful!* If your block falls off the edge, your game is over.

Ultimately, I didn't feel I made enough progress on it to submit.

It is not very fun, and very unaesthetic - but if you want to play it anyway, here it is: <https://ryanbraganza.github.io/upblock/>

## Controls

### Placing a block

 1. Hold Spacebar - start growing a block
 2. Release Spacebar - stop growing a block, and start moving it
 3. Press Spacebar - drop the block

Once the block has come to a stop, repeat the process to build as high as you can!

### Starting a new game

 1. Press Escape when the game is over to start a new game
